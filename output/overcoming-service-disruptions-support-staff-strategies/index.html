                        <p>Service disruptions occur when there is an unexpected interruption in the delivery of service, affecting customer experience and operational efficiency. Understanding these disruptions is crucial for organizations aiming to maintain a high standard of service and protect their reputation.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Definition of Service Disruptions</h3>
