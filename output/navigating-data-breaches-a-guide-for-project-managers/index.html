                        <h3>Reputational Damage</h3>
<p>A data breach can tarnish a company&#39;s reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust. Project managers need to be aware of the long-term effects of reputational damage and work on strategies to rebuild trust.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Loss of Customer Trust</h3>
<p>Customers expect their data to be secure. A breach can lead to a significant decline in customer confidence, resulting in decreased sales and customer loyalty.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Impact on Brand Loyalty</h3>
