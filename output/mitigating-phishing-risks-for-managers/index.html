                        <h2>Understanding Phishing Attacks</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Definition of Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing is a cybercrime that involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications. It is a prevalent tactic used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Types of Phishing Attacks</h3>
<p>There are several types of phishing attacks that managers should be aware of to protect their organizations.</p>

                            
                        <h4>Spear Phishing</h4>
<p>Unlike generic phishing attempts, spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations, often using personal information to appear legitimate. Cybercriminals may research their victims extensively, making these attacks particularly dangerous.</p>

                            
                        <h4>Whaling</h4>
<p>Whaling is a type of spear phishing that specifically targets high-profile individuals, such as executives or key decision-makers within an organization. These attacks often involve highly personalized messages that can lead to significant financial losses or data breaches.</p>

                            
                        <h4>Vishing and Smishing</h4>
<p>Vishing (voice phishing) and smishing (SMS phishing) are variations of phishing that utilize phone calls and text messages, respectively, to deceive victims. These methods often involve social engineering tactics to extract sensitive information over the phone or through deceptive text messages.</p>
