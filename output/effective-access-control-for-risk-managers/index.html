                        <p>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows resource owners to determine who can access their resources. It provides flexibility but can lead to inconsistent permissions management if not monitored carefully. This model is commonly used in smaller organizations where the owner has the authority to grant or revoke access.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</h3>

                            
                        <p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a more rigid approach where access rights are regulated by a central authority based on predefined policies. Users cannot alter access permissions, making it suitable for environments that require higher security levels, such as government agencies and military organizations.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>

                            
                        <p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns access rights based on user roles within the organization. This method simplifies permissions management by grouping users with similar job functions, ensuring they have access only to the information necessary for their roles. RBAC is widely adopted in enterprises for its balance of security and usability.</p>
