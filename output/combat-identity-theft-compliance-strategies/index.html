                        <p>The impact of identity theft is significant, affecting both businesses and consumers. For businesses, it can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities. For consumers, the consequences can be devastating, resulting in financial loss, emotional distress, and long-term effects on their credit scores.</p>

                        <h3>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)</h3>

                            
                        <p>The GLBA requires financial institutions to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.
