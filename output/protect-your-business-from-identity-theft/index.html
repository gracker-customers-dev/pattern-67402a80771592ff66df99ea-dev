Businesses often hold sensitive data, making them prime targets for identity theft. The impact can ripple through an organization, leading to loss of revenue, legal issues, and a tarnished reputation. Therefore, it is paramount for executives to foster awareness of identity theft&#39;s risks and implement protective measures.</p>

                        <h3>Fraudulent Transactions</h3>

                            
                        <p>Fraudulent transactions encompass unauthorized purchases made using stolen business or customer information. These transactions can lead to direct financial losses and complications in financial reporting.</p>
