                        <h2>Introduction to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Definition of Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, such as an online account or a network. This process enhances security by combining something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (like a smartphone), and something the user is (like a fingerprint).</p>

                            
                        <h3>Importance of MFA in Modern Business Environments</h3>
